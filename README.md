# Excalibur

Excalibur is a retro-style brush based level editor; designed for the modern world.

## User Guide

TBD (sorry)

## Development

Excalibur is a [Tauri](https://tauri.app) application with a [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) frontend.

### Getting Started

You will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed. You'll also probably need to install Rust and system dependencies - see the [Tauri guide](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/getting-started/prerequisites) for this.

To get started, install the JS dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, to start the Tauri application in development mode:

```bash
npm run tauri dev
```
